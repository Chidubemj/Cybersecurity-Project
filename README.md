# SOC-PROJECT.
This project enhances security monitoring at 10ALYTICS-DC by leveraging Wazuh to detect and respond to unauthorized Netcat processes, a common tool for data exfiltration and backdoors. The solution involves deploying Wazuh for real-time process monitoring, generating alerts for suspicious activities, and implementing active responses to terminate malicious processes. Alerts are integrated with Slack for real-time notifications.
